Xtern Class of 2020 Data Science -- Truman Brubaker

I added several columns for the data, dist_from_bus, dist_from_new_bus, dist_from_last, charge_time,
time_from_bus and time_from_new_bus.
dist_from_bus: Column that contains the distance from the point 20.19, 20.19.
dist_from_new_bus: Column that contains the distance from the optimal bus location (0.355608222011024,
 0.231251456934552), or zero, depending on if the scooter needs to be charged or not.
charge_time: Amount of time the scooter would need to charge (5-power_level)
time_from_bus: Amount of time for the bus to get from 20.19, 20.19, to scooter's current location
time_from_new_bus: Amount of time for the bus to get from the optimal bus location to the scooter, or zero
if the scooter is at full charge
dist_from_last: distance from the previous scooter's row. Optimization of the sum of these would minimize
travel time to every scooter location. Removing fully charged scooters might be good.

total_charge_time: 64271 hours, or, assuming you can always charge 50 scooters at a time, and you always
have 50 non-fully charged scooters, 1285.42 hours.

Bus location X, Bus location Y: Optimal locations for new place for charging bus to park, with least
total proximity from example dataset scooters.
